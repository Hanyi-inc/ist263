<h2>Personal Introduction</h2>
<p>I am a junior at Syracuse University Newhouse School of Public Communications, majoring in Advertising and minoring
    in Computer Engineering. While focusing learning real-world advertising skills, I am very interested in data
    analyzing and software development.</p>

<h2>More about me</h2>
<p>Besides that, I am also a photography enthusiast. I like to visit the wilderness in my free time for outdoor
    photography and aerial photography, and I also like to use specific lenses for portrait photography. You can see
    some of my photography on this website.</p>
