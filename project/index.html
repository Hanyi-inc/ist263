<div class="personal"><p>I am a junior at Syracuse University Newhouse School of Public Communications, majoring in
    Advertising and minoring
    in Computer Engineering. While focusing learning real-world advertising skills, I am very interested in data
    analyzing and software development.</p></div>
<div class="personal"><p>I am currently studying Advertising at Syracuse University. Advertising is an art, not only in
    production and publicity, but more in researching product personality, researching consumer needs, formulating and
    implementing creative strategies. Dynamic. Resilient. Adaptable. Advertising doesnâ€™t just survive in a shifting
    media climate;</p></div>

<h2>More about me</h2>
<p>Besides that, I am also a photography enthusiast. I like to visit the wilderness in my free time for outdoor
    photography and aerial photography, and I also like to use specific lenses for portrait photography. You can see
    some of my photography on this website.</p>
